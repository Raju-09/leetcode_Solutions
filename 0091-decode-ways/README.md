## Problem Description

You have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers. The message is **decoded** via the following mapping:

<code>"1" -> 'A'<br />
"2" -> 'B'<br />
...<br />
"25" -> 'Y'<br />
"26" -> 'Z'</code>

However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes (`"2"` and `"5"` vs `"25"`).

For example, `"11106"` can be decoded into:

	- `"AAJF"` with the grouping `(1, 1, 10, 6)`

	- `"KJF"` with the grouping `(11, 10, 6)`

	- The grouping `(1, 11, 06)` is invalid because `"06"` is not a valid code (only `"6"` is valid).

Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.<br />
<br />
Given a string s containing only digits, return the **number of ways** to **decode** it. If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return `0`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

 

<strong class="example">Example 1:</strong>

**Input:** s = "12"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

"12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

<strong class="example">Example 2:</strong>

**Input:** s = "226"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

"226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

<strong class="example">Example 3:</strong>

**Input:** s = "06"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

"06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06"). In this case, the string is not a valid encoding, so return 0.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 100`

	- `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).
