## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Evaluate the expression. Return *an integer that represents the value of the expression*.

**Note** that:

	- The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.

	- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

	- The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.

	- There will not be any division by zero.

	- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.

	- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a **32-bit** integer.

 

<strong class="example">Example 1:</strong>

```

**Input:** tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

```

<strong class="example">Example 2:</strong>

```

**Input:** tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

```

<strong class="example">Example 3:</strong>

```

**Input:** tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
**Output:** 22
**Explanation:** ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4`

	- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.
